# liri-node-app

8: LIRI Bot

In this assignment, I've made a LIRI. LIRI is like an iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

# What Each Command Does :

- node liri.js movie-this
- node liri.js spotify-this-song
- node liri.js do-what-it-says
